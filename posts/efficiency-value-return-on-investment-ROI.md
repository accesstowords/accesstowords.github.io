Fostering strong and lasting relationships with customers is a wise strategy of big-thinking leadership. While many organisations strive for excellence in customer communication, there exists a powerful yet under-utilised tool -accessible translations. Incorporating BSL translations, simplified easy-read texts and spoken words, readable typefaces, and international translations  into your customer communication strategy not only enhances efficiency and provides exceptional value but also contributes significantly to increasing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). In this blog post, we will explore the multifaceted benefits of embracing accessible communications in your customer interactions and the positive impact they can have on your CLV.

**Efficiency Gains**

*Expanding Inclusivity*

By integrating accessible translations into your communication, you cast a wider net of inclusivity, ensuring that Deaf and hard-of-hearing customers, blind and partially sighted customers, dyslexic customers, customers with limited literacy, and customers for whom English is not their first language can all access your messages effortlessly. This expanded accessibility immediately boosts your CLV by engaging a previously underserved demographic.

\
*Precision in Communication*

Our AI translations offer precise, unambiguous communication. The visual language of sign incorporates gestures, facial expressions, and body movements, conveying subtle nuances that written or spoken words may not capture.  Our spoken word generated audio conveys emotion and nuance across all desired languages.  And our easy-read, simplified written and spoken words convey all of the original meaning and intent, presented in a way that allows many people with reading or comprehension challenges the opportunity to embrace your content.  
This clarity minimizes misinterpretations and elevates the overall customer experience, enhancing CLV by fostering loyalty and trust.

*Swift Issue Resolution*

Efficient communication is pivotal when addressing customer concerns. Our translations and communication delivery expedite the process by enabling your customer long-tail to articulate their problems effectively. This leads to quicker issue resolution, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, which, in turn, bolsters CLV.

Brands that prioritise inclusivity are perceived positively, setting you apart from competitors. Your commitment to serving diverse customer needs can attract and retain customers, driving long-term CLV growth.

\
*Strengthened Customer Loyalty*

Customers who feel seen and valued are more likely to remain loyal to your brand. Inclusive, accessible communications signal your genuine effort to cater to the unique requirements of all of your customers, creating a sense of belonging and trust. This enhanced loyalty is instrumental in driving CLV.
\
\
*Compliance and Risk Mitigation*

In some regions, legal requirements mandate accessible communication options for individuals with disabilities. By embracing accessible commuications, you not only fulfill these obligations but also mitigate legal risks. Avoiding potential penalties and reputation damage safeguards your CLV in the long run.

**Return on Investment (ROI)**

Modern technology and services have made implementing BSL translations more cost-effective than ever before. Outsourcing translation services or using AI-powered accessibility interpreters can provide a cost-efficient solution, especially when weighed against potential losses from neglecting a significant customer segment.

Expanding your reach to disabled customers through inclusive, accessible communications opens new revenue streams. As these customers gain access to your products and services, you can anticipate a positive impact on your revenue, driving CLV growth over time.

The goodwill generated from accommodating Deaf and hard-of-hearing customers holds immense value. A positive brand image and reputation translate into increased customer loyalty, referrals, and repeat businessâ€”all of which contribute to CLV growth.
